# Genotyping-by-Sequencing and its applications in ecology and evolution

Tuesday June 11 2019 | 09:00 - 12-30 | [Seminar Room, Benham Building](https://goo.gl/maps/62XWtwgqsKxKir4V9)



## Introduction

Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) in the broad sense has been revolutionising population genomics by bringing state of the art genomic technologies within reach of most researchers.

**This Mini-symposium is open to everyone** and will serve as an opening for a two day hands-on workshop introducing the practicalities of GBS. We are delighted to be able to present a range of talks from various departments and institutions connecting researchers across the country.


**Organised by:** Ludovic Dutoit and Alana Alexander

**Supported by:** The Department of Zoology @Otago, Genomic Aotearoa, The New Zealand eScience Infrastructure
