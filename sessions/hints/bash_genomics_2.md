2. Copy the chicken genome *chicken.fa* from: 

```
/nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/source_data/chicken.fa
```

in the newly created *chicken_genome_exercise/* directory.


**HINT:** The command ```cp``` should help you here. It takes two arguments, the origin and the destination. Use the argument `--help` to ask for help if you need to know options for any of the commands used for this challenge.
