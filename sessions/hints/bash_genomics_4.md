Can you tell the total length of the genome? This command can take a little bit of time to run!

**HINT:** Use grep to find all the lines who *do not* start with the ">" symbol. You can ```|```into another command. The ```wc``` command counts lines with the ```-l``` argument, but could you count characters instead? Use the argument `--help` to ask for help if you need to know options for any of the commands used for this challenge.
